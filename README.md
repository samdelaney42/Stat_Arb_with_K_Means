# K_Means

In this project I aim to re-create the unsupervised machine learning k-means clustering technique with random and plusplus initialization methods, then use class in a stat arb trading model.

To do:
- Implement in statistical arbitrage pair trading model
- Test stat arb strat with different:
  - beta lookback periods
  - Z score entry and exit thresholds
- Itterate through clusters and generate porfolios with multiple pairs positions
